# inventory
The inventory resource keeps track of how many of each product we have in our warehouse. At a minimum it should reference a product and the quantity on hand. Check with the Product team for the format of the product id. Inventory could also track restock levels and the condition of the item (i.e., new, open box, used). Restock levels will help you know when to order more products. Being able to query products by their condition (e.g., new, used) could be very useful.
